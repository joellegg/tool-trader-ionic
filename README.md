# tool-trader

## Overview

Tool-trader is a mobile app that allows you to borrow or rent tools from friends and locals, rather than buying a tool you may only use once. Maybe, you need a special tool to get the job done. Maybe, you hate having tools cluttering your garage. Or maybe, you have a bunch of spare tools lying around gathering dust and you want to make some spare cash. Either way, tool-trader is for you.
